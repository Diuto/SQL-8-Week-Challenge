# SQL-8-Week-Challenge
Danny Ma's 8 Weeks SQL Challenge is an 8-week coding challenge for those who wish to practice (and hopefully, perfect) their SQL skills. 
About a year ago, I was learning SQL, and had supposedly gotten good enough with it to start taking projects. A friend of mine recommended
this challenge to me, being what he had taken himself in his early SQL days. 

However, I found myself learning a whole plethora of other tools. In the end, SQL is the first language (I try hard enough not to call it 
a programming language) that has made sense to me since I opened my first ever IDE to learn programming. I love it, and I was always going
to come back to it for Data Analysis. One day, hopefully, I get to use it professionally as a data analyst or database administrator. Now, however, here's to having fun with Danny Ma's little teasers.

If you think you can help me make my dream come true, you're already in my Github, but you could:

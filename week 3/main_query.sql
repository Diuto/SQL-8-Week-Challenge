--SECTION D: TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
/*
1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
I would analyse Quarter-on-Quarter growth for revenue and number of customers. I would also analyse QoQ churn rate and plan upgrades vs downgrades.

2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
The same metrics I mentioned in #1.

3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
I would some sort of hypothesis testing to see what behaviours (plan subscriptons, probably usage too, if data is available) are common to churners.

4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey
-Why do you want to leave our service?
-What was your favourite foodie-fi feature?
-What was your least favourite foodie-fi feature?
-On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend foodie-fi to a friend?

5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
-Advertising
-Offering loyalty bonuses (like a free month of service after 18 straight monthly plans or 2 annual plans)
-User generated content or user-requested content

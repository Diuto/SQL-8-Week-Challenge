After week 3 of "Danny Ma's SQL Target Practice", as I like to call it now, I can say I am truly buzzing to have started this.
It's incredible what a little practice can do to your love for SQL. 

The major thing I learnt this week was RECURSIVE CTEs; a concept I had not heard of before; I initially tried to think of a way to use 
the "for" loop to solve my problems when I stumbled into SQL Recursive CTEs. I'm pleased to have added that to my repertoire.
I answered all the questions, including the technical questions at the end (Section D, answered as comments) and 
I believe I did justice to each one based on interpretation.

Some SQL skills used for this week's practice include;
- Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Date/Time Intelligence
- Analytical Thinking

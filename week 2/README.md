# Pizza Runner

In this week's task, I am presented with one of data professionals' biggest nemeses; DIRTY DATA. 
The dataset is a relational database containing 6 tables, all describing the various aspects of Pizza Runner's trade; from the orders to 
runners, to runner activities, and even pizza recipes. 

The task had 5 sections of business questions that tore through a lot of what I know in SQL. 
Some of the skills used in this week's challenge include; 

- Data Definition
- Data Cleaning (and data wrangling)
- Joins
- Window Functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Subqueries
- Time series analysis, etc.

There are three queries in the project;

- dataset: containng DDL queries to create the tables and set the query path
- data_wrangling: containing the queries used to clean the original data
- main_query: containing the actual queries used to answer the business questions.

Queries contain comments to walk readers through my thought process on some of the more complicated queries.

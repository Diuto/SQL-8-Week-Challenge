# Danny's Diner

In this week, I answer 10 questions for Danny, an enthusiastic chef who has just opened a restaurant and will like to understand his growing customer base and plan for the future.

Some of the skills used this week are;

- Joins
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions
- Window Functions
